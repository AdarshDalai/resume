## Summary

Final-year Computer Science student with hands-on experience building user-centric Android applications using Jetpack Compose and scalable backend systems with Python and FastAPI. Proven ability to develop innovative solutions, demonstrated through projects involving AI/ML (Gemini API, T5, FAISS) and cloud technologies (AWS, Azure). Eager to contribute expertise in Java, Kotlin, Python, and modern development practices to create impactful software solutions at a dynamic tech company.

## Projects

**AppConnX: Research Project** | [Link](https://github.com/AdarshDalai/AlmaConnX)

*Technologies: T5 Transformer, FAISS, RAG, MongoDB, FastAPI, Docker, Python*
* Developed a profile-matching backend by fine-tuning a T5 transformer model to generate and tokenize profile embeddings, integrating FAISS indexing to enhance profile matching retrieval speed.
* Engineered a prompt-based recommendation scoring system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), assigning weights for prompt relevance to improve matching accuracy.
* Built and deployed a high-performance RESTful API using FastAPI linked to MongoDB Atlas for efficient data delivery and user profile management.
* Containerized the backend service using Docker, ensuring dependency isolation and simplifying deployment processes.

**Tasker: Gemini powered task management application** | [Link](https://github.com/AdarshDalai/Tasker)

*Technologies: Jetpack Compose, Firebase, Gemini API, Kotlin, Android*
* Developed a native Android task management app featuring Gemini API integration to automatically manage, prioritize (based on severity/completion status), and generate context for tasks derived from user prompts, aiming to improve user organization and productivity.
* Implemented automated task organization leveraging context analysis via the Gemini API, providing contextual summaries for each task to streamline user workflow within the Android application.

## Internships

**Ingenious-tech World**
*Software Development Engineering Intern (July 2024 - January 2025)*

* **Task:** Redesign the authentication flow for a client's Android app to improve user experience.
    * **Action:** Designed and implemented a modular authentication UI using Jetpack Compose, focusing on intuitive design and efficient user flow. Packaged the UI as a reusable Android library distributed via JitPack.io.
    * **Result:** Improved user onboarding efficiency by 20% and reduced codebase redundancy across related projects by 30% through the reusable library.
* **Task:** Enhance a virtual tour application with an immersive image viewing feature.
    * **Action:** Built a 3D panoramic image viewer integrating Google's Street View API. Added functionality for navigation using the device's gyroscope sensor data for intuitive motion controls.
    * **Result:** Delivered an interactive 3D viewing feature, significantly enhancing the virtual tour app's user engagement and experience.

## Achievements

* **Google Developer Student Clubs Lead (2023-24):** Founded the university chapter, led a core team of 8, and grew the community from 0 to 450+ members through workshops and events.
* **2nd Place:** Awarded second place and a cash prize in the university's Entrepreneurship Development project competition.
